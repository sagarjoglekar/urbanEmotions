Recommendation: Accept

Additional Questions:
Review's recommendation for paper type: Full length technical paper

Should this paper be considered for a best paper award?: Yes

Does this paper present innovative ideas or material?: Yes

In what ways does this paper advance the field?: This paper proposed a transparent deep learning FaceLift framework that beautifies existing urban scenes. 
This translates into two main technical advancements. 
First, FaceLift is able to generate realistic scenes as opposed to existing approaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks whose final transformations are quite coarse as they still take the form of synthetic templates. 
Second, it augments the deep learning black-box with a module that offers explanations on what has been transformed, making that box more transparent.

Is the information in the paper sound, factual, and accurate?: Yes

If not, please explain why.: 

What are the major contributions of the paper?: This paper proposed a transparent deep learning FaceLift framework that beautifies existing urban scenes. 
This data should ideally be stratified according to the people’s characteristics that impact their perceptions. The other main limitation is that generative models are hard to control, and more work has to go into offering principled ways of fine-tuning the generative process.
Despite these limitations, FaceLift has the potential to support urban interventions in scalable and replicable ways: it can be applied to the scale of an entire city, and that can be replicated in other cities. 
The advantage of shifting the focus of research away from predictive analytics towards urban interventions is that people could be part of discussions on works of architecture more than they are nowadays. To turn existing spaces into something more beautiful, that will still be the duty of architecture.

Recommendation: Needs Minor Revision

Comments:
This paper still has some flaws that should be addressed.
1.Related work section is not detailed enough, and I doubt the number of references is enough for a comprehensive literature review.
2.The description of the framework is not clear enough, and some details are missing, such as the network structure of the deep learning model.
3.Given an input image which is beautiful, does the framework return a more beautiful image or an ugly image? If it is the former, how to measure whether it really becomes more beautiful.
4.The paper needs another round of proofreading to eliminate some typos and grammar errors.

What are the major contributions of the paper?: This paper proposes a deep learning framework (FaceLift) that is able to both generate a beautiful scene (or, better, beautify an existing scene) and explain why that scene is beautiful. In order to evaluate whether the framework is able to produce beautified scenes, this paper proposes a family of four urban design metrics they have formulated based on a thorough review of the literature in urban planning.

Recommendation: Needs Major Revision

Comments:
This paper proposed a deep learning based framework, FaceLift, which is able to generate realistic scenes and offer explanations on what has been transformed with the deep learning (making that black box more transparent).
The topic of this paper is interesting and the result is good. I recommend accepting this paper, however, I suggest the authors to make revision, as some parts of this paper need more clear description and adjustment.
(1)	There are two main contributions at this paper. First is generating better urban scenes and second is able to explain deep learning framework with detail. But I think these two aspects are different, and address both of them will not highlight the main topic or innovation well. Actually, I cannot find, or the authors do not explicitly point out how to make “black-box” of CNN more apparently with detail description. So I suggest the authors only highlight one of them.
(2)	About “Q4 Do architects and urban planners find it useful?”, as the results shown in Table 6, I find that the rating from “definitely not” to “definitely” without a “neutral” option, and this will lead to bias.
(3)	In Fig.8 there are five urban design metrics, but in the section of abstract and Table 4, there are only four metrics: walkability, green, openness, and visual complexity.
