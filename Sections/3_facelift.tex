%****************************************
The goal of FaceLift is to take as input a geo-located urban scene and give as output its transformed (beautified) version. 
To that end, it performs in five steps: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Curating urban scenes} It is common knowledge that deep learning systems need immense amount of data. In this first step we try to develop a sound framework for curating and augmenting annotated images, on which the model could be trained.
	\item \textbf{Training a beauty classifier} To generate beauty, you first need a reliable model that could learn the representation of beauty. To achieve this, we train a deep learning model that could distinguish beautiful urban scenes from non-beautiful urban scenes. 
	\item \textbf{Generating a synthetic beautified scene} Based on the learned representation of beauty, we train a generative model which could augment the beauty of an input urban scene. 
	\item \textbf{Retrieving a realistic beautified scene} as showcased in Figure\ref{fig:framework}, the generated images are representations of beautified input urban scene in a latent space. This latent representation needs to be transformed back to a realistic looking image, using retrieval.
	\item \textbf{Identifying the urban elements characterizing the beautified scene} In the final step, the framework explains changes introduced in the transformation process in terms of literature-driven urban design metrics, and quantifies these changes as metrics for urban beauty.
\end{itemize}
%1) curating urban scenes; 2) training a beauty classifier; 3) generating a synthetic beautified scene; 4) returning a realistic beautified scene; and 5) identifying the urban elements characterizing the beautified scene. 
%\ns{You need a bit more detail here. First sentence says what you are going to achieve. But you need to motivate why these specific five steps will achieve this goal.}


%****************************************
\subsection*{Step 1 Curating Urban Scenes}
\label{Sec:dataset}
To begin with, we need highly curated training data with labels reflecting urban beauty. We start with the  Place Pulse dataset that contains 100k Google Street Views across 56 cities around the world~\cite{dubey2016deep}. These scenes are labeled in terms of whether the corresponding places are likely to be perceived beautiful, depressing, rich, and safe. We focus only on those scenes that are labeled in terms of beauty and that have at least three judgments. This leave us with roughly  20,000 scenes. To transform judgments into beauty scores, we use the TrueSkill algorithm~\cite{herbrich2007trueskill}, which gives us a way of partitioning the scenes into two sets (Figure \ref{fig:Trueskill}): one containing beautiful scenes, and the other containing ugly scenes. The resulting set of scenes is too small for training any deep learning model without avoiding over-fitting though. As such, we need to augment such a set. 

We do so in two ways. First, we feed each scene's location into the Google Streetview API to obtain  the snapshots of the same location at different camera angles (i.e., at $\theta \in {-30^{\circ}, -15^{\circ} , 15^{\circ} , 30^{\circ} }$). However, the resulting dataset is still too small for robust training. Therefore, again, we feed each scene's location into the Google Streetview API, but now we do so to obtain other scenes at  distance $d \in \{10,20,40,60\}$ meters.  This will greatly expand our set of scenes, but it might do so at the price of introducing scenes whose beauty scores have little to do with the original scene's. To fix that, we take only the scenes that are \emph{similar} to the original one (we call this way of augmenting ``conservative translation''). To compute the similarity between a pair of scenes, we represent the two scenes with visual features derived from the FC7 layer of PlacesNet and compute the similarity between the two corresponding feature vectors~\cite{zhou2014learning}. For all scenes at increasing distance $d \in \{10,20,40,60\}$ meters,  we take only those whose similarity scores with the original scene is above a threshold. In a conservative fashion, we choose that threshold to be the median similarity between rotated and original scenes (those of the first augmentation step). 

To make sure this additional augmentation has not introduced any unwanted noise, we consider  two sets of scenes: one containing those that have been taken during this last step, i.e. the one with high similarity to the original scenes (\emph{taken-set}), and the other containing those that have been filtered away (\emph{filtered-set}). Each scene is then scored with PlacesNet~\cite{zhou2014learning} and is represented with the five most confident scene labels. We then aggregate labels at set level, by computing each label's frequency on the \emph{taken-set} %minus that on the 
and on the \emph{filtered-set}. Finally, we characterize each label's propensity to be correctly augmented as: 
$ \textrm{prone}(label)= fr(label,\textrm{\emph{taken-set}}) - fr(label,\textrm{\emph{filtered-set}}).$
This reflects the extent to which a scene with a given label is prone to be augmented or not. From Figure~\ref{fig:augmentationSimilarity}, we find that, as one would expect, scenes that contain highways, fields and bridges can be augmented at increasing distances while still showing resemblances to the original scene; by contrast, scenes that contain gardens, residential neighborhoods , plazas, and skyscrapers cannot be easily augmented, as they are often found in high density parts of the city, where there is tremendous diversity within short distances. 

%\ns{You probably want to reword this: It is amenable to augmentation, not prone to. Also why is this being done at a set level? If you always find bridges next to viaducts and viaducts next to bridges, and if your translation step moves from one to another, then the set-level score will not detect this. If instead you check whether the placesnet\_label of the translated image is the same as that of the original, then you are OK, as long as placesnet\_label can be be believed.}

\subsection*{Step 2 Training a beauty classifier}
\label{Sec:Classifier}
Having this highly curated set of labeled urban scenes, we are now ready to train classifier $C$ with labels reflecting our beauty assessments. We use the CaffeNet architecture, a modified version of AlexNet~\cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet,szegedy2015going}. The classifier network has a conventional convolutional network architecture, with 5 convolutional layers, interleaved with Max pooling and normalization layers. The network is terminated with two 4096 dimensional fully connected layers interleaved with dropout~\cite{srivastava2014dropout} layers, with dropout ratio of 0.5, to prevent over-fitting of the network. Finally the classifier categorizes the images into one of two classes (beautiful(1), ugly(0)) through a Softmax layer that computes probabilities of class membership.

The training is done on a 70\% split of the data, and the testing on the remaining 30\%. All this is done on increasingly augmented sets of data. We start from our 20k images and progressively augment them with  the snapshots obtained with the 5-angle camera rotations, and then with the exploration of scenes at increasing distance $d \in \{10,20,40,60\}$ meters. The idea behind data augmentation is that accuracy would increase with it. Indeed it does (Table~\ref{tab:classifier}): it goes from 63\% on the set of original scenes to as much as 73.5\% on the set of fully augmented scenes, which is a notable increase in accuracy for such classes of classification tasks. As a baseline, we compare with the models trained by Dubey et.al~\cite{dubey2016deep} on the same seed data that we use for our pipeline. They report that their models perform at 70\% accuracy in the task of picking a beautiful image amongst any two given images. Albeit the set-up of our model is not to compare two images but just to classify a particular image in a binary class, this baseline shows that our model is showing a comparable performance in beauty classification. 
%As a baseline, we compared with the scenic-or-not model developed by Chanuki et.al \cite{seresinhe2017using}. Their model is different than ours because of the fact that their model generates scenic scores on a scale of 10, whereas ours is a binary classifier. Still for the sake of comparison, we measure the Kendall rank correlation, which is what they use for their measurements, between predicted and actual classes. Our model performs with a Kendall rank correlation of 0.43 which is comparable to their elastic net models. In so far, the facelift pipeline is agnostic of the classifier , which can be swapped out with a better performing one or with one trained for a different use case. 
%\ns{Can you cite a baseline comparison from state of the art? Less important but comment on why is accuracy the right metric? Why not precision for instance?}.

\subsection*{Step 3 Generating a synthetic beautified scene}

\begin{table}\sffamily
    \begin{tabular}{l*2{C}@{}}
        \toprule
        & Original & Generated \\ 
        \midrule
        & \includegraphics[width=11em]{Plot/GAN_examples/orig_1} & \includegraphics[width=11em]{Plot/GAN_examples/gan_1} \\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{ Sample examples of the outputs of the Generator network. The original scenes and the generated scenes are shown side by side. }
    \label{fig:GanExample}
\end{table} 


Having this trained classifier at hand, we can then build a generator of synthetic beautified scenes. There are two components of this step. The first is a generator of synthetic scenes given an a-priori feature vector $f$, extracted from image $I_f$. For this component, we retrain the GAN described by Dosovitskiy and Brox~\cite{dosovitskiy2016generating} on the curated urban scene dataset described in Section~\ref{Sec:dataset}. This network is trained by optimizing along the principles of Generative Adverserial Networks~\cite{goodfellow2014generative} i.e., maximizing the confusion for the discriminator between generated image $G(f)$ and real dataset images $I_f$. The resulting generator is able to reproduce synthetic urban scenes to an impressive level of detail. Figure~\ref{fig:GanExample} shows a few examples of how the generator performs by comparing a real world image $I_f$, and the generated image $G(f)$. The second component is a concatenation of  the trained generator with the beauty classifier described in Section~\ref{Sec:Classifier}, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:AM_arch}. This results in the end to end model that, given the two classes ugly $y_i$ and beautiful $y_j$, transforms any original scene $I_i$ of class $y_i$ (e.g., ugly scene) into template scene $\hat{I_j}$ that maximizes class $y_j$ (e.g., beautified template scene). 

More specifically, given an input image $I_i$ known to be of class $y_i$  (e.g., ugly), our technique outputs  $\hat{I_j}$, which is a more beautiful version of it (e.g., $I_i$ is morphed  towards the average representation of a beautiful scene) while preserving $I_i$'s details. The technique does so using the ``Deep Generator Network for Activation Maximization'' (\emph{DGN-AM})~\cite{nguyen2016synthesizing}. Given an input image $I_i$, \emph{DGN-AM} iteratively re-calculates the color of $I_i$'s pixels in  a way  the output image $\hat{I_j}$  both maximizes  the  activation of neuron $y_j$ (e.g., the ``beauty neuron'') and looks ``photo realistic'',  which is done by conditioning the maximization to an ``image prior''. This is equivalent to finding the feature vector $f$ that maximizes the following expression:
\begin{equation}
\hat{I_j} =G( f ) : \underset{f}{\arg\max}(C_{j}(G(f))-\lambda||f||)
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $G(f)$ is the image synthetically generated from the candidate feature vector $f$;
\item $C_j(G(f))$ is the activation value of neuron $y_j$ in the scene classifier $C$ (the value to be maximized);
\item $\lambda$ is a $L_2$ regularization term.
\end{itemize}
Here the initialization of $f$ is key. If $f$ were to be initialized with random noise, then the resulting $G(f)$ would be the average representation of category $y_j$ (of, e.g., beauty). Instead, since $f$ is initialized with the feature vector corresponding to $I_i$, then the resulting maximized $G(f)$ is $I_i$'s version ``morphed to become more beautiful''.
Maximizing beauty of an already beautiful urban scene, would yield in a saturated template $\hat{I_j}$. For this reason, to generate an image that maximizes the beauty neuron in the classifier $C$ , we supply the network with an a-priori image that most definitely lies in the class $y_i$. The constraint is reverse for maximizing for class $y_i$.

%****************************************
\subsection*{Step 4 Returning a realistic beautified scene}
 We now have template scene $\hat{I_j}$ (which is a synthetic beautified version of original scene $I_i$) and need to retrieve a realistic looking version of it. We do so by: \emph{i)} representing each of our original scenes in Step 1 (including $\hat{I_j}$) as a 4096 dimensional feature vector derived from the FC7 layer of the PlacesNet~\cite{zhou2014learning}; \emph{ii)} computing the distance (as $L_2$ Norm) between $\hat{I_j}$'s feature vector and each of the original scene's feature vector; and \emph{iii)} selecting the original scene most similar (smaller distance) to $\hat{I_j}$. This results into the selection of the beautified scene $I_j$.
 
 
 %****************************************
\subsection*{Step 5 Identifying  characterizing urban elements}
Since original scene $I_i$ and beautified scene $I_j$ are real scenes and we make sure that they maintain the same structural characteristics (e.g., point of view, layout), we can easily compare them in terms of presence or absence of SegNet's and PlacesNet's labels. That is, we can determine how the original scene and its beautified version differ in terms of urban design elements. This step required us to develop metrics inspired from urban design literature, to quantify the changes in elements. A detailed description of the characterization and evaluation would follow in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation}.
