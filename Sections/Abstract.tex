Deep learning has allowed remarkable insights when it comes to analysis of images. But the quality to understand what a model learns and does is still out or reach. 
In this paper we propose a Deep Learning driven processing pipeline called \textsl{FaceLift}, that allows us learn intangible concepts in urban settings like beauty, safety and richness. For the purpose of specificity, we conduct all our studies on the dimension of beauty in urban images, but the process is extensible to any annotated property. In addition to learning these concepts, the pipeline allows approximate transformation of street-view images so as to maximize or minimize these concepts in  urban settings. We further design the pipeline using a novel explain-ability aimed architecture with a tandem of Generative Adversarial and Deep Neural networks. We validate our pipeline's Transformational capabilities using crowd sourced experiments and then evaluate the pipeline using several metrics, drawn from Urban design Literature. We conclude by summarizing actual expert insights about the use of such a tool and discuss the broader implications.
