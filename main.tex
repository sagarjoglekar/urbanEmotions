\begin{abstract}
In the area of computer vision, deep learning techniques have recently been used to predict whether urban scenes are likely to be considered beautiful:  it turns out that these techniques are able to make accurate predictions. Yet they fall short when it comes to generating actionable insights for urban design. To support urban interventions, one needs to go beyond \emph{predicting} beauty, and tackle the challenge of \emph{recreating} beauty. Unfortunately, deep learning techniques have not been designed with that challenge in mind. Given their ``black-box nature'', these models cannot be directly used to explain why a particular urban scene is deemed to be beautiful. To partly fix that, we propose a deep learning framework (which we name  FaceLift) that is able to both \emph{beautify} existing Google Street views and \emph{explain} which urban elements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively evaluate our framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem at hand has never been tackled before) and need to  formulate new ones. These new metrics should ideally capture the presence (or absence) of elements that make urban spaces great.  Upon a review of the urban planning literature, we identify \textsl{five} main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and visual complexity.  We find that, across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes meet the expectations set by the literature on what great spaces tend to be made of. This result is further confirmed by a 20-participant expert survey in which FaceLift have been found to be effective in promoting citizen participation. These results suggest that, in the future, as our framework's components are further researched and become better and more sophisticated, it is not hard to imagine technologies that will be able to accurately and efficiently support architects and planners in the design of the spaces we intuitively love.
